        until the purpose for which it was stored no longer applies. If you request deletion or revoke your consent to
        data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your

        after these reasons no longer apply.</p>
    <h3>General Information on Data Processing Legal Bases on This Website</h3>
    <p>If you have given your consent to data processing, we will process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6
        para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9 para. 1
        GDPR are processed. In the event of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data
        processing will also take place on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the
        storage of cookies or access to information on your terminal device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data
        processing will additionally be based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your
        data is required for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we
        will process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if
        necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be based
        on our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases for data processing
        in each individual case are provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. Sometimes, the transmission of
        personal data to these external parties is necessary. We only pass on personal data to external parties if this
        is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to
        tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the transfer, or if
        another legal basis permits the transfer of data. When using data processors, we only pass on personal data of
        our customers based on a valid data processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing
        agreement is concluded.</p>
    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have
        already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains
        unaffected by the revocation.</p>
    <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
    <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF
        YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, INCLUDING PROFILING BASED ON THESE
        PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU
        OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE
        GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO
        ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
    <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME
        TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING, INCLUDING PROFILING TO THE
        EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO
        LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
    <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
    <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the
        alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or
        judicial remedies.</p>
    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a
        contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct
        transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
    <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
    <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored
        personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing at any time, and, if necessary, a
        right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions regarding
        personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
    <h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any
        time for this purpose. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the
            duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal
            data.</li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data is unlawful, but you oppose the deletion of the data and instead
            request the restriction of its use.</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal
            claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of
            deletion.</li>
        <li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your
            interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests outweigh the others, you have the right
            to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may only be
        processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of
        the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European
        Union or a member state.</p>
    <h2>4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>
    <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
    <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your
        browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Time of the server request</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These data will not be merged with other data sources.</p>
    <p>The collection of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate
        interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of his website – for this purpose, the
        server log files must be recorded.</p>
    <h2>5. Plugins and Tools</h2>
    <h3>Google Fonts (Local Hosting)</h3>
    <p>This site uses so-called web fonts provided by Google for the uniform display of fonts. When you call up a page,
        your browser loads the required web fonts into its browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</p>
    <p>For this purpose, the browser you are using must connect to Google's servers. This enables Google to know that
        your IP address has been used to access our website. The use of Google Web Fonts is in the interest of a uniform
        and appealing presentation of our online services. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of
        Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
    <p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a default font will be used by your computer.</p>
    <p>Further information about Google Web Fonts can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google's
